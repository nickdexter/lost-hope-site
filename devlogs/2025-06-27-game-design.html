                The gritty overrun look of Killing Floor has always been a
                favourite of mine. The atmosphere of the game makes you feel
                overpowered by the ZEDs (enemies) and it feels like you're truly
                fighting for your survival.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game uses Unreal Engine 2.5 which achieves its lighting
                mainly through baked lightmaps and vertex lighting, with little
                real-time lights. This should be fairly easy to replicate in
                Unity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gunplay has always been Killing Floor's strong suit with
                satisfying sounds, animations, and overall gun feel. This is
                something I look to emulate in LOST HOPE.

                COD: Zombies perks are purchased mid-game with points earned
                that game. They're non-permanent and must be unlocked each play
                session. I like the idea of adding a similar system to LOST
                HOPE.

                PAYDAY's skill tree and builds are what kept me playing for over
                a thousand hours. Coming up with interesting builds combining
                different weapons, armour, perk decks, and skills to optimize
                for the highest difficulty.
              </p>
              <p>
                LOST HOPE will feature skill trees as its main way of providing
                players with different play-styles.

                Bulletstorm's skillshot system adds variety to what I'd
                otherwise consider rather bland gunplay. It encourages players
                to experiment with different weapons and discover combos for big
                point bonuses. Although rather arcadey, It's something I'm
                considering adding. It helps keep the gameplay feeling fresh.

                PIGFACE is another game I take visual inspiration from. I love
                the PS2 era look with its bilinear blurry textures and
                low-to-mid poly models.
